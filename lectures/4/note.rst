*Function* is an important concept in programming, because it allows us to
easily modularize our programs and reuse the codes in the future. In this
lecture, I will show you how to write functions in `C++`_.

Fundamental Concepts of Functions in `C++`_
-------------------------------------------

Currently, we write everything inside the :ref:`main <intro_simple_cpp_main>`
function. This is fine for small projects, say homework assignments. However,
for larger projects, this can be very limited. Consider the following
situation.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int flag;
    std::string method;
    // do something with flag
    flag = ...;
    switch (flag) {
    case 0:
        method = "method1";
        break; // don't forget break the switch
    case 1:
        method = "method2";
        break;
    case 2:
        method = "method3";
        break;
    default:
        method = "default";
        break;
    }

    // then run different statements with different "methods"


This code looks fine, but assume you need to determine the "method" twice in
your program, then the intuitive solution would be: "okay, let's just copy
and paste this part." This, of course, works, but what about later on, you need
to add another method, say "method4". You need to add "method4" twice, otherwise
your program may run into troubles.

At this moment, you probably already notice the limitation of this approach,
i.e. not extendable and easy to introduce bugs. A right way is to use a
function:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:

    std::string chooseMethods(int flag) {
        std::method;
        switch (flag) {
        case 0:
            method = "method1";
            break; // don't forget break the switch
        case 1:
            method = "method2";
            break;
        case 2:
            method = "method3";
            break;
        default:
            method = "default";
            break;
        }
        return method;
    }

Now, in your program, whenever you need to determine the "method", you can
simply **call** the function ``chooseMethods``:

.. code-block:: cpp

    int flag;
    std::cout << "enter method flag integer: ";
    std::cin >> flag;
    std::string method = chooseMethods(flag);

In this way, everytimes when you need to add a new method, there is only
once place you need to worry about, i.e. the function ``chooseMethods``.

Now, let's take a closer look at the function above, in which ``chooseMethods``
is its *name*, :code:`std::string` is the *return type*, and :code:`int flag`
is the *parameter list*.

.. tip:: Functions are objects.

Essentially, every function has:

1. a name,
2. a return type, and
3. a parameter list.

.. _lec4_func_empty_return:

Be aware that both 2 and 3 can be empty argument, i.e. ``void`` for empty
return and empty parameter list for the latter.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // an empty param list with empty return
    void printHelloWorld() {
        std::cout << "Hello World\n";
    }

Be aware that *empty value return* doesn't mean there is no return in the
function. The code above is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: cpp
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    void printHelloWorld() {
        std::cout << "Hello World\n";
        return;
    }

The emphasized line demonstrates that this function returns *empty value*.
Returning empty value is not necessary, but sometimes it can be useful.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void doWork(double *data) {
        *data = 1.0;
    }

For the ``doWork`` function, you can simply use it like:

.. code-block:: cpp

    double a;
    doWork(&a); // recall address-of operator to get the pointer
    std::cout << "a=" << a << ".\n"; // print 1

However, we know that if ``data`` is ``nullptr``, then we have a big problem,
i.e. recall dereferencing ``nullptr`` will cause ``seg fault``.

In this case, you can do a *quick return* by checking ``data``, and this
requires returning empty stage.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void doWork(double *data) {
        if (!data) {
            return;
        }
        *data = 1.0;
    }

The Return Type
+++++++++++++++

The return type of a function must be listed explicitly and uniquely, i.e.
you cannot have a function that has multiple return types.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int myFunc() { return 1; } // Ok
    // int, int want2Return2Ints() { return 1, 2; } // ERROR!

However, there are always workarounds to mimic multiple returns that appear
in dynamic languages, e.g. `Python`_. One of them is to use a
:ref:`struct <lec3_stm_loop_struct>`.

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct ComplexNumber {
        double real;
        double imag;
    }; // don't forget the semicolon

    ComplexNumber getDefaultComplexNumber() {
        ComplexNumber a;
        a.real = 0.0;
        a.imag = 0.0;
        return a;
    }

Nonempty return types can be handles or omitted.

.. code-block:: cpp

    bool assign(const int len, double *array, const double value) {
        if (!array || len < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
            array[i] = value;
        }
        return true;
    }

You can use the function above either

.. code-block:: cpp

    if (!assign(len, array, value)) {
        // recall that you should use cerr for error streaming
        // if the inputs are not acceptable, then we know that array is not
        // been touched
        std::cerr << "invalid inputs\n";
    }

or, simply do

.. code-block:: cpp

    assign(len, array, value);


The Parameter List
++++++++++++++++++

The :code:`(int flag)` in ``chooseMethods`` and :code:`(double *data)` in
``doWork`` are called parameter lists. In general, the parameter list of
functions is a *comma-separated* *declaration-like* of parameters. Therefore,
for a parameter list, multiple arguments are, of course, supported.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void demoParList(int a, double b, std::string method, double *data) {
        // do work
    }

.. note::

    The `C++`_ function parameter lists have strict order, i.e. there is
    not *key value pairs* in `C++`_ regarding function inputs.

Return Pointers & References
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There is nothing to stop you from returning :ref:`pointers <lec2_ptr>` and
:ref:`references <lec2_ref>`. However, whenever you directly access the memory,
special care must be taken.

Let's first look at the following function that returns a pointer:

.. code-block:: cpp

    int *getPointer() {
        int a = 1;
        int *ptr = &a;
        return ptr;
    }

On return, ``getPointer`` will return a **copy** of ``ptr`` and this behavior
is well defined. Now, let's look at the the *function body* (content inside
the function scope). A **local** integer ``a`` is created as well as a pointer
``ptr`` that points to it. The memory address of ``a`` is copied whiling
returning ``ptr``, but ``a`` is popped out from the stack right after the
return statement. **Therefore, the dereference of the returned pointer is
undefined.**

Typically, returning pointers is used for
:ref:`dynamic memory allocation <lec2_dyn>`:

.. code-block:: cpp

    double *allocArray(unsigned int size) {
        return new double [size];
    }

.. note:: Don't forget to relax the memory.

.. tip::

    If you need to write a function that returns a pointer pointing to
    the head memory, it's general practice that the function name should start
    with ``create``, ``alloc``, etc.

Returning references, on the other hand, is even tricker.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int &getRef() {
        int a;
        return a;
    }

The code above has the legal `C++`_ syntax. However, the returned reference
refers to some local variable that is gone once the function scope ends.
As a result, the refer you get from this function is undefined.

.. note::

    Typically, compilers will warn you for returning local references.

.. note::

    For new `C++`_ programmers, avoid returning references.

Forward Linked List, again, with Functions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now, a more structured implementation of our
:ref:`forward linked list example <lec3_stm_loop_struct>` can be found in
:nblec_4:`func_fll`.

.. _lec4_func_pass:

Passing Arguments
-----------------

A very good example to understand argument passing in `C++`_ is the following
``swap`` function. A swapping operation is to exchange the contents between
two objects. Let's take a look at the following pseudo code of swapping:

.. code-block:: matlab

    Inputs: obj1, obj2
    Outputs: obj1 w/ value of obj2, and obj2 w/ value of obj1

    function swap(obj1, obj2)
    do
        obj1 <-> obj2
    end do

Following the pseudo code and with the knowledge in high level programming
languages, you probably simply come with a `C++`_ implementation:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void Swap1(int a, int b) {
        const int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }

However, this code will not work. The reason is simple, because both ``a`` and
``b`` are copied locally inside the function thus having no effects to the
actual inputted parameters.

The Copy Property
+++++++++++++++++

By default, all arguments are copied by their values thus resulting
locally scoped variables. For instance, let's take a look at the following
usage of our "wrong" swapping function.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int lhs = 1, rhs = 2;
    Swap1(lhs, rhs);
    std::cout << "after swapping, lhs="<< lhs << ", rhs=" << rhs << ".\n";

During the calling of ``Swap1``, ``lhs`` and ``rhs`` are copied as local
variables ``a`` and ``b``, so they have totally different memory addresses
comparing to the original ``lhs`` and ``rhs``. Therefore, any operations
performed on ``a`` and ``b`` have no effects to ``lhs`` and ``rhs``.

Since we have just mentioned memory addresses, you probably can simply come
up a proper implementation like:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void Swap2(int *a, int *b) {
        const int temp = *a;
        *a = *b;
        *b = temp;
    }

Now, the local copies of ``a`` and ``b`` are the pointers that still point to
the input arguments. Therefore, the code above can successfully swap the
contents.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int lhs = 1, rhs = 2;
    Swap2(&lhs, &rhs); // be aware that we pass in memory addr
    std::cout << "after swapping, lhs="<< lhs << ", rhs=" << rhs << ".\n";

In programming, this copy property is referred as *pass by values* (PBV).
Notice that with PBV, you duplicate each of the parameters thus doubling
the memory usage.

.. note:: `MATLAB`_, by default, has PBV property.

Download and play around with :nblec_4:`swap`.

*Pass by References* (PBR)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`C++`_ allows you pass parameters as their references. This is a convenient
feature that allows one to write efficient code.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void Swap3(int &a, int &b) {
        const int temp = a;
        a = b;
        b = a;
    }

In the code above, instead of creating copies, two references that bind to
the input arguments are created. Recall that references are just alternative
names of their corresponding objects, therefore, any modification will affect
the original variables.

.. tip::

    Use :code:`const` reference with :code:`std::string` whenever possible.

In general, the creation of an :code:`std::string` requires a dynamic memory
allocation (because the size of the string is unknown) and a memory copying.
As a result, passing :code:`std::string` by value can be very inefficient.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // first printing
    void print1(std::string msg) {
        std::cout << msg << '\n';
    }

    // second printing
    void print2(const std::string &msg) {
        std::cout << msg << '\n';
    }

    std::string msg = "hello world!";

    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
        print1(msg);
        print2(msg);
    }

For the example above, without additional efforts, the first version requires
more resources than the second one does due to 10000 additional times of
dynamic memory allocation and data copying.

.. tip::

    Link we have learned in the :ref:`reference <lec2_ref>` section, the same
    rule applies for using references with functions, i.e. use :code:`const`
    whenever possible.

PBV vs. PBR
++++++++++++

In general, if the data is too large so that copying it becomes the bottleneck
of your programs, then you should switch to use PBR.

Considering ``Swap2`` and ``Swap3``, both of them perform the swapping
operation. The former requires copying the pointers, while references are
passed for the latter. For this case, it's hard so say which one is preferred.

.. tip::

    People come converted from C programming usually prefer passing objects
    by their memory addresses (pointers), because it's clear to them that the
    objects will be modified. For native `C++`_ programmers, the latter is
    usually used. But the drawback is that sometime people get confused about
    the function interface, e.g. the interface is identical for ``Swap1`` and
    ``Swap3``.

Function Prototypes & Implementations
--------------------------------------

Declarations & Definitions of Variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In :ref:`defining and initialing variables <lec1_define_init>`, we have learned
how to define a variable, say :code:`int a;`. With this simple piece of code,
two steps actually happen: 1) *declaring* ``a`` as an ``int``, and 2)
*defining* it in the stack memory.

We can, of course, explicitly separate these two steps by using the keyword
``extern`` in `C++`_.

.. code-block:: cpp

    extern int a;  // declaration

    int main() {
        std::cout << "a=" << a;
        return 0;
    }

    // define a
    int a = 1;

The separation of declarations and their corresponding definitions is
significant in `C++`_ (as well as in C), because this allows us to structure
libraries (packages) whose declarations go to the *header files* and
definitions stay in the *source files*. These concepts will be taught in the
future lecture.

.. note::

    Declarations can appear as many times as you want, but definitions must
    be unique!

.. code-block:: cpp

    extern int a;  // declaration
    extern int a;  // Ok
    extern int a;  // No problem

    int main() {
        std::cout << "a=" << a;
        return 0;
    }

    // define a
    int a = 1;
    // int a = 2; // ERROR, we already learned

Constant variables can also be declared first.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // declaration
    extern const int b;

    int main() {
        std::cout << "b=" << b;
    }

    const int b = 2; // define it, must be initialized


"Declarations" of Functions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In `C++`_, a function's declaration is called *prototype*.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void myFunc(); // note that the semicolon indicates prototype
    void myFunc(); // you can declare as many times as you want...

Notice that :code:`extern` is optional.

"Definitions" of Functions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A function's definition is called *implementation*.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void myFunc() {
        std::cout << "calling myFunc\n";
    }

Notice that the implementation of a function is indicated by the scope
opener (:code:`{`) and closer (:code:`}`).

Function Types & Function Pointers
----------------------------------

Recall that `C++`_ is a static language, which all the variables must have
their unique types. Unsurprisingly, functions are variables thus having their
types.

At the beginning the :ref:`the basis section <lec4_func_basis>`, we have
learned that any functions are associated with a return type and a list of
parameter arguments. Therefore, the type of a function can be determined by
the return type and the parameter list.

For instance, let's look at the simplest function, which takes nothing and
returns empty.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void Empty() {}

Its return type is ``void`` and input argument list is empty, or ``void``.
So we can say that function ``Empty`` is determined by a function type that
returns ``void`` and takes ``void``.

Syntactically, the type of ``Empty`` is ``void(void)`` (C/`C++`_) or simply
just ``void()`` (`C++`_). In general, the type of a function is given by the
following syntax: :code:`return_type(type1, type2, ...)`, for example, the
``Swap2`` function has type of :code:`void(int*, int*)`.

.. note::

    Function declaration (prototyping) is actually like any other declarations
    thus having type and variable name. The difference is that the variable name
    is in the middle of the type,  i.e. :code:`void Empty()`. In this case, it
    is very similar to defining arrays, i.e. :code:`int array2[2]`, where
    ``array2`` is the variable that has type of :code:`int[2]`.

.. code-block:: cpp
    void Empty();// type then name
    int array2[2];// type name


With a type precisely defined, we expect, of course, its pointer and reference
defined as well. The syntax is as following:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void (*)(); // function pointer pointing to void()
    void (&)(); // function reference referring to void()

.. note::

    Dereferencing function pointers will evaluate the function pointers
    themselves.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int Identity(int a) {
        return a;
    }

    // define the function pointer
    int (*fun_ptr)(int);

    int main() {
        // explicit
        fun_ptr = &Identity;
        // implicit
        fun_ptr = Identity;
        // dereference evaluates back to pointer
        fun_ptr = *Identity;
        // or...
        fun_ptr = ***Identity;
    }

The existence of function pointers is useful. because it allows us to pass
functions to other functions as their parameter list's arguments.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void call(void (*func)()) {
        func(); // call the function
    }
    int call2(int (*func)(int)) {
        return func(2); // type is int(int)
    }

.. tip::

    You should always use function pointers.

.. note::

    Function pointers are very old-school. We will learn using
    *lambda calculus* and/or :code:`<functional>` in `C++`_ in the future.

Default Arguments
-----------------

One of the important features in high level programming languages is to use the
so-called *default arguments*.

Default parameters are not allowed in the middle of a parameter list.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void doWork1(int a, int b, double tol = 1e-12, double sigma=2.0); // ok
    void doWork2(int a, int b = 1, int c); // ERROR! b must appear after c

With default parameters, you can use ``doWork1`` in the following ways:

.. code-block:: cpp

    doWork1(1, 2); // Ok, equiv to doWork1(1,2,1e-12,2.)
    doWork1(1, 2, 1e-4); // Ok, overwrite tol
    doWork1(1, 2, 1e-2,3.0); // Ok

.. warning::

    Default parameters can only be used for function prototyping, they are not
    allowed in function definitions that are separated from the declarations.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int f1(int a = 1); // declaration
    // int f1(int a = 1) { return a;} // ERROR!
    int f1(int a) { return a; } // OK

    int f2(int a = 1) { return a; } // OK, declaration and definition together

The :nblec_4:`default` is a good example of showing using default argument with
function as input argument for computing derivatives.

.. _lec4_func_adv_ov:

Function Overloading
--------------------

Recall that when you first learned about :ref:`types <lec1_types>` in `C++`_, I
told you that the names of variables are unique. However, `C++`_ allows you to
have multiple functions with same name under certain situations. This exception
is, roughly speaking, called *function overloading*.

To be more precise, function overloading is: *functions that have the same name
but different parameter lists and that appears in the same scope.*

.. code-block:: cpp

    // consider the following two interface for computing
    // the mean of an array
    double dmean (const int n, const double *array);
    float smean (const int n, const float *array);

    // C++ function overloading allows you to have a unified interface
    // for them, i.g.
    double mean(const int n, const double *array);
    float mean(const int n, const float *array);

.. note::

    Overloaded functions cannot differ only in the return types!

.. code-block:: cpp

    // The following "overloading" of fun is not allowed!!
    double fun();
    float fun(); // This will throw error!

The Beauty
++++++++++

C programming does not allow function overloading, this is very inconvenient. I
like to use the absolute function as an example and this function is provided
in both C and `C++`_ standard libraries.

`C++`_ defines integer absolute value functions in :code:`<cstdlib>` and
floating siblings under :code:`<cmath>`. For plain old C, they are defined in
:code:`<stdlib.h>` and :code:`<math.h>`.

+-----+------------+------------+------------+------------+
|     | ``float``  | ``double`` | ``int``    | ``long``   |
+=====+============+============+============+============+
| C   | ``fabsf``  | ``fabs``   | ``abs``    | ``labs``   |
+-----+------------+------------+------------+------------+
| C++ | ``abs``    | ``abs``    | ``abs``    | ``abs``    |
+-----+------------+------------+------------+------------+

As you can see, in C, there is a uniquely defined ``abs`` function for each of
the built-in type. With the power of function overloading, a unified interface
``abs`` is defined for all built-in types.

Take a look at the :nblec_4:`overloading`.

The Traps
+++++++++

Function overloading is powerful, but you need to use it with special care. Now
consider the following example.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void f(int a);
    void f(int a, int b = 1);

The functions above have different parameter list, so they are valid overloaded
functions. But now, in the program we you try to call ``f``, we will run into
problem.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int main() {
        f(1); // which one????
    }

This is called *interface ambiguous error* in `C++`_ and the compiler will
abort. However, the tricky part is that when you build the library with the two
``f``, the compiler will not complain.

Also, let's take a look at the example below.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void f(int a);
    void f(const int a);

It seems to you that ``int`` and ``const int`` are "two" types, but with
regards of the function parameter, they are same. Therefore, the ``f`` above
is not considered as function overloading, and if you try to define them
separately, you will have multiple definitions error.

Function Matching (optional section)
------------------------------------

.. todo:: Need to convert this part from my old lecture slides.
